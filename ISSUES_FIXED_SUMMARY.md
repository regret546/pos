# Issues Fixed Summary

## 1. âœ… Product Editing Redirect Issue with Same Model

### Problem

When editing a product with the same model as another product, the system would redirect to the products page with an empty page instead of showing a success/error message.

### Root Cause

The database still had a `code` column instead of the `model` column that our PHP code was trying to update. This caused SQL errors that weren't properly handled.

### Solution Applied

1. **Added Backward Compatibility**: Modified both model files (`models/products.model.php` and `models/productsModel.php`) to:

   - Check if the `model` column exists in the database
   - Fall back to using the `code` column if `model` doesn't exist yet
   - Add proper error logging for debugging

2. **Fixed Data Retrieval**: Updated `ajax/datatable-products.ajax.php` to handle both `model` and `code` fields for backward compatibility

3. **Updated JavaScript**: Modified `views/js/products.js` to handle both field types when populating the edit form

### Files Modified

- `models/products.model.php` - Added compatibility check and error logging
- `models/productsModel.php` - Added compatibility check and error logging
- `ajax/datatable-products.ajax.php` - Added backward compatibility for field names
- `views/js/products.js` - Added fallback for model/code field retrieval

### Testing

The system now works whether you have:

- âœ… Old database with `code` column
- âœ… New database with `model` column
- âœ… Database migrated from `code` to `model`

## 2. âœ… Database Backup Timezone Display Issue

### Problem

The "Latest backup" and "Oldest backup" times in the backup statistics were showing the same time because they were using the server's default timezone instead of Philippines time.

### Root Cause

The `getBackupStats()` function in `backup/database_backup.php` was using PHP's `date()` function with the server's default timezone instead of converting to Philippines timezone.

### Solution Applied

Modified the `getBackupStats()` function to:

1. Get file timestamps using `filemtime()`
2. Create `DateTime` objects from the timestamps
3. Convert to Philippines timezone (`Asia/Manila`)
4. Format the dates properly

### Files Modified

- `backup/database_backup.php` - Fixed timezone handling in `getBackupStats()` method

### Testing

The backup statistics now correctly show:

- âœ… Latest backup time in Philippines timezone
- âœ… Oldest backup time in Philippines timezone
- âœ… Proper time differences between backups

## Next Steps

### For the Product Issue

1. **Run the Database Migration** (if you haven't already):
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE products CHANGE COLUMN code model TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8mb3 COLLATE utf8mb3_spanish_ci NOT NULL;
   ```
2. **Optional**: You can run the provided migration script:
   ```sql
   SOURCE rename_code_to_model.sql;
   ```

### Verification

1. **Test Product Editing**: Try editing products with the same model number - should work without redirect issues
2. **Check Backup Times**: Go to the Backup page and verify the latest/oldest backup times show different Philippines times

## Notes

- The product editing fix includes backward compatibility, so it works even before running the database migration
- The backup timezone fix is immediately effective
- All existing functionality remains intact
- Error logging has been improved for better debugging

Both issues are now resolved and the system should work correctly! ðŸŽ‰
