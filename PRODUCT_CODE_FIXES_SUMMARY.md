# Product Code/Model Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Product Code Duplication Issue ✅

**Problem**: When editing a product, all products with the same code would get updated because the edit query used `WHERE code = :code`.

**Solution**: Changed the edit query to use the unique `id` field instead:

- Modified `models/products.model.php` and `models/productsModel.php` to use `WHERE id = :id`
- Added hidden field for product ID in the edit form
- Updated controller to pass the product ID instead of relying on code
- Updated JavaScript to populate the product ID field

### 2. Changed "Code" to "Model" Throughout System ✅

**Changes Made**:

- Database queries now use `model` column instead of `code`
- Frontend forms updated (labels, placeholders, table headers)
- PDF reports now show "MODEL" instead of "CODE"
- DataTables updated to display model field
- JavaScript functions updated to handle model field

## Files Modified

### Backend Files

- `models/products.model.php` - Fixed edit query and changed field names
- `models/productsModel.php` - Fixed edit query and changed field names
- `controllers/products.controller.php` - Added ID handling and changed field names

### Frontend Files

- `views/modules/products.php` - Added hidden ID field, updated labels and table headers
- `views/js/products.js` - Updated to populate ID field and handle model instead of code
- `ajax/datatable-products.ajax.php` - Updated to use model field
- `ajax/datatable-sales.ajax.php` - Updated to show model in sales tables

### Reports/PDF Files

- `extensions/tcpdf/pdf/acknowledgment-receipt.php` - Shows "MODEL" instead of "CODE"
- `extensions/tcpdf/pdf/bill-a4.php` - Shows "MODEL" instead of "CODE"

## Database Migration Required

**IMPORTANT**: You need to run the database migration to rename the column from `code` to `model`.

### Option 1: Automatic Migration (Recommended)

Run the provided SQL migration script:

```sql
-- Run this in your database:
SOURCE rename_code_to_model.sql;
```

### Option 2: Manual Migration

If you prefer to run the migration manually:

```sql
ALTER TABLE products CHANGE COLUMN code model TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8mb3 COLLATE utf8mb3_spanish_ci NOT NULL;
```

### Verify Migration

After running the migration, verify it worked:

```sql
SELECT COLUMN_NAME, COLUMN_TYPE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = DATABASE()
AND TABLE_NAME = 'products'
AND COLUMN_NAME IN ('code', 'model');
```

You should see only the `model` column, not `code`.

## Testing

After running the migration, test the following:

1. **Add New Product**: Verify you can add products with model numbers
2. **Edit Product**: Verify editing one product doesn't affect other products with the same model
3. **Product Listing**: Verify the table shows "Model" column correctly
4. **Sales Reports**: Verify PDFs show "MODEL" instead of "CODE"
5. **Product Deletion**: Verify product deletion works correctly

## Benefits

1. **No More Duplicate Updates**: Editing a product with model "HP Pavilion" will only update that specific product, not all HP Pavilion products
2. **Clearer Terminology**: "Model" is more appropriate than "Code" for product variants
3. **Unique Identification**: Each product is now properly identified by its unique ID
4. **Data Integrity**: The system now prevents accidental bulk updates

## Notes

- The system still allows multiple products with the same model number (e.g., different HP Pavilion variants)
- Each product maintains its unique ID for precise identification
- All existing data will be preserved during the migration
- The migration script is safe to run multiple times (it checks if the change is needed)
